## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- Chosen for its excellent TypeScript support, built-in optimization, and modern React patterns
- App Router provides better code organization and performance

**Styling**: TailwindCSS 
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Built-in dark mode support
- Consistent design system

**Data Fetching**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- Intelligent caching and background updates
- Built-in loading and error states
- Request deduplication and cancellation

**State Management**: React hooks + localStorage
- Minimal complexity for this scope
- localStorage for favorites persistence
- URL as source of truth for filters/search

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### 1. **Component Structure**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/          # Header, navigation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pokemon/         # Pokemon-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ filters/         # Search and filtering
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/             # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/      # Context providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              # Custom React hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/               # Utilities and API functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/             # TypeScript definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app/               # Next.js app router pages
```

#### 2. **URL as Source of Truth**
- All filters, search queries, and pagination state are reflected in the URL
- Enables shareable links and browser back/forward navigation
- Implemented with Next.js `useSearchParams` and `useRouter`

#### 3. **Progressive Image Loading**
- Official artwork as primary source
- Automatic fallback to sprite images
- SVG placeholder for missing images
- Blur placeholders for smooth loading

#### 4. **Request Cancellation Strategy**
- AbortController integration with React Query
- Prevents race conditions during rapid filtering
- Improves performance and user experience

#### 5. **Accessibility-First Design**
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimizations
- Focus management

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting**: Detail pages are dynamically imported
2. **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with proper sizing
3. **Query Optimization**: Intelligent caching with React Query
4. **Bundle Analysis**: Optimized imports and tree shaking
5. **Lazy Loading**: Images and components load progressively

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
No environment variables required - the app uses the public Pok√©API.

### Customization

#### Theme Configuration
Modify `tailwind.config.js` to customize colors and styling:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      pokemon: {
        fire: '#F08030',
        water: '#6890F0',
        // Add custom type colors
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### API Configuration
Update `src/lib/api.ts` to modify:
- Request timeouts
- Retry strategies
- Cache durations

## üì± Features Walkthrough

### Home Page
- Grid layout of Pok√©mon cards with infinite scroll
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Type filtering and sorting options
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

- **Favorites**: Toggle to show only favorites
- **URL Sync**: All state persisted in URL

### Dark Mode

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search functionality works with debouncing
- [ ] Filters persist in URL and on page reload
- [ ] Favorites toggle and persist in localStorage
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works and persists
- [ ] Images load with proper fallbacks
- [ ] Infinite scroll loads more Pok√©mon
- [ ] Detail pages show comprehensive information
- [ ] Error states display with retry options
- [ ] Loading states show during data fetching

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 85+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## üöß Known Limitations & Trade-offs

### Current Limitations

1. **Search Scope**: Client-side search limited to loaded Pok√©mon (Pok√©API doesn't support server-side search)
2. **Image Availability**: Some Pok√©mon may have missing official artwork
3. **Offline Support**: No offline functionality (future enhancement)
4. **Type Filtering**: When filtering by type, pagination resets (API limitation)

### Design Trade-offs

1. **Client-side Search vs Server-side**: 
   - **Chosen**: Client-side with large initial load
   - **Trade-off**: Better UX but higher initial bandwidth
   - **Rationale**: Pok√©API lacks search endpoints

2. **localStorage vs Database**:
   - **Chosen**: localStorage for favorites
   - **Trade-off**: Data not synchronized across devices
   - **Rationale**: Simpler implementation, no backend required

3. **Infinite Scroll vs Pagination**:
   - **Chosen**: Infinite scroll with manual load more
   - **Trade-off**: Less precise navigation but better mobile UX
   - **Rationale**: Modern UX patterns, better for discovery

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Basic E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Error boundary implementation
- [ ] PWA capabilities (service worker, offline support)
- [ ] Pok√©mon comparison feature

### Medium-term
- [ ] Advanced filtering (stats, abilities, generations)
- [ ] Team builder functionality
- [ ] Export/import favorites
- [ ] Sound effects and animations

### Long-term
- [ ] User accounts with cloud sync
- [ ] Social features (share teams, favorites)
- [ ] Advanced analytics and insights
- [ ] Multi-language support
